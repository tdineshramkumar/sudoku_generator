# Python Sudoku Generator
This project generates sudoku puzzles that are relatively hard to solve.
Run the main.py script to generate problems and their corresponding solutions.
They are saved as images in problems/ and solutions/ folder. 
### HOW DOES IT WORK
It generates random sudoku by first randomly filling the diagonal squares (3x3).
Then it finds a random solution for this generated sudoku.
It then removes cells one by one randomly and ensures that only unique solution 
exists for the sudoku. It removes only cells which on removing still guarantees a
unique solution. It tries to remove as many cells as possible.
### PDF
After running the main.py, run the pdf.py to aggregate the problems and solutions
generated by the main.py and saves it into a single PDF document with 
problems and solutions separated into separate sections.
